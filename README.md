# ZPack
Mod for the game Barotrauma

Added Items:
Revolver Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 24 revolver rounds)
Shotgun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 12 shotgun shells)
Harpoonstack (Container holding a maximum of 12 harpoons)

The revolver and shotgun ammo boxes are small items that can be stored anywhere.
To make it a bit more realistic the harpoonstack is medium so it won't fit in a toolbox and some other containers.

A movable content window opens when any of the items are equiped to make reloading a little less clumsy. 
If it annoys you, don't equip them, just use from the inventory. 
Having two containers equiped(opened) at the same time is buggy. 
The content window of one doesn't always appear even if they are not overlapping.
