# ZPack
Mod for the game Barotrauma

The mod was created before item stacking was added to the game so now it is too overpowered.
Stacking should have made this mod obsolete, but the devs didn't balance anything, so 8 revolver bullets take the same amount of space as 8 grenades...

I don't want to lower the container capacity of the ammo boxes in this mod as at update you could lose items in them so I'm creating another Mod called ZPackAmmoBoxes2 with rebalanced capacity Ammo Boxes. Buy those items and destroy these.
(The best would be to rebalance the stacking capacity, but doing that in a mod would override the vanila items and that could cause problems later when they change something.)

Added Items:
Revolver Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 24 revolver round stacks)
Shotgun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 12 shotgun shell stacks)
Grenade Launcher Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 4 grenade stacks)
Harpoon Stack (Container holding a maximum of 12 harpoon stacks)
Battery Box (Container holding a maximum of 4 batterie stacks)
Stungun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 6 stungun dart stacks)
SMG Magazine Stack (Container holding a maximum of 2 SMG magazines)

The ammo boxes are small items that can be stored anywhere except the harpoonstack.
To make it a bit more realistic the harpoonstack is medium so it won't fit in a toolbox and some other small containers.

A movable content window opens when any of the items are equiped(taken in had) to make reloading a little less clumsy. 
(If you find that annoying, don't equip them, just use from the inventory.)

Having two containers equiped at the same time is buggy. 
The content window of one doesn't always appear even if they are not overlapping.
