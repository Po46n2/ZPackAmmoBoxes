# ZPack
Mod for the game Barotrauma

Added Items:
Revolver Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 24 revolver rounds)
Shotgun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 12 shotgun shells)
Grenade Launcher Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 4 grenades)
Harpoon Stack (Container holding a maximum of 12 harpoons)
Battery Box (Container holding a maximum of 4 batteries)
Stungun Ammo Box (Container holding a maximum of 6 stungun darts)
SMG Magazine Stack (Container holding a maximum of 2 SMG magazines)

The ammo boxes are small items that can be stored anywhere except the harpoonstack.
To make it a bit more realistic the harpoonstack is medium so it won't fit in a toolbox and some other small containers.

A movable content window opens when any of the items are equiped(taken in had) to make reloading a little less clumsy. 
(If you find that annoying, don't equip them, just use from the inventory.)

Having two containers equiped at the same time is buggy. 
The content window of one doesn't always appear even if they are not overlapping.
